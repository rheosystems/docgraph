## Model

## User

A user has an email address as a natural key (Use as primary
key). Additionally full name.

A user can be part of many projects and a project has many
users. Therefore need a many-to-many table. See code below and note
that we are using a composite primary key.

```
Table: project_users
  user_email references users(email),
  project_reference references projects(reference),
  PrimaryKey (user_email, project_reference)

```

A user profile should show which projects the user is a member of.
A project profile should show the users that are members of the project.
